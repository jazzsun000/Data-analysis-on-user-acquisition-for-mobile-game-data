(UA mean user acquisition)

You will know how to calculate the relevant UA metrics and evaluate the UA campaign performance with R programming.

1.The UA  insight trend we will provide here:

a.The trend of new installs

b.The trend of D1_DAU

c.How is the performance on Retention_rate?

d.The trend of ARPDAU_Day_1

e.The trend of LTV_Day_1


2.How is the campaign performance look like?

a.ROI_180 performance evaluation

b.How is the Life_time_value_model_function look like?

Assume LTV_180 = ARPDAU_180*Life_time(1-180)

This LTV function got from GDC lecture (Retention Approach) 

https://mobiledevmemo.com/two-methods-modeling-ltv-spreadsheet/ 


It assumes the retention function is a power function (y=a*x^b) and that ARPDAU is constant. 

Assume retention rate will follow the power function y=ax^b, x:days since install,y:retention rate

c.ROAS performance evaluation

d.CPM_Spend performance evaluation

e.Retention_Day_7 performance evaluation

f.ARPDAU_D7 performance evaluation
